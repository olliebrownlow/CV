## Oliver Brownlow

**Junior developer** with a background in, and passion for, problem solving.

Before completing Makers Academy, I studied theoretical linguistics (syntax and semantics with a focus on the structure of English) to PhD level, and in between, have held positions both in teaching and management. What has consistently made me feel most alive is a good problem to solve and the knowledge gained in doing so.

I offer you a language agnostic, quick learner with a focus on TDD and schooled in Agile project management. I maintain a positive, can-do attitude, a smart eye for detail and a fierce logic that, if unleashed, will add real value to any company. I am looking for the right company to unleash it, a company that will push me to adhere to best practices, commit to my continual professional development and offer genuine support as I grow my skillset with them. This company will ideally be based in London.

Any successful PhD candidate requires the following three properties: perseverance, tenacity and cogency - three properties also essential for taking on and completing the Makers coding Bootcamp.

#### Perseverance..

..as a link to the ability to imagine credible solutions. In the face of challenges that may invoke uncertainty, frustration and perhaps a touch of imposter syndrome, Makers, as an extension to PhD "schooling" has taught me, once again, the importance of this trait. Perseverance is necessary to take you to a place where your problem-solving intuition allows you to exercise sound judgment not only in the most suitable approach to a solution, but also the likelihood of that approach being successful over an alternative.

The first 3 years of my PhD I spent reading around the topic and developing baseline approaches, most of which would eventually prove unfruitful. The path to completing it did no become fully clear until the last 6 months. Perseverance slowly unlocked a plausible approach. Coding problems match this also on a micro-scale, needing hours or sometimes days rather than months and years to solve.

Programming, just like high-level study, is the presentation of not just one problem, but a constant flow of them, each perhaps needing a different approach. Natural language study throws out these problems at every turn. Likewise, coding as a means to an end result. Being able to break these problems down into smaller solvable ones is a skill acquired through tenacity and crucial for software development.

#### Cogency..

..as a route to clear conveyance of work and reasoning. Writing a PhD demands coherent, logical and convincing communication. It is no doubt useful to understand what you yourself mean to transmit when discussing or showing your work, but with built in cogency, others will also understand, and from that point, a truly collaborative environment can function well. With this in mind, I endeavour always to use best coding practices.
