## Oliver Brownlow

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

**Full-stack junior web developer**, with a background in, and passion for, problem solving. 

Before starting Makers Academy, I studied theoretical linguistics (syntax and semantics with a focus on the structure of English) to PhD level, and in between, have held positions both in teaching and management. What has consistently made me feel most alive is a good problem to solve and the knowledge gained in doing so.

I offer you a quick learner with a positive, can-do attitude, compfortable working in an agile development environment and with a smart eye for detail and a fierce logic that, if unleashed, will add real value to your company. I am looking for the right company to unleash it, a company that will push me to adhere to best practices, will commit to my continual professional development and will offer genuine support as I grow my skillset with them. This company will ideally be based in London.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, RSpec.

## Skills

Any successful PhD candidate requires the following three properties: perseverence, tenacity and cogency - three properties also essential for taking on and completing the Makers coding Bootcamp.

#### Perseverence..

..as a link to the ability to imagine credible solutions. In the face of challenges that may inspire uncertainty, frustration and perhaps a touch of imposter syndrome, Makers, as an extension to PhD "school" has taught me, once again, the importance of this trait. Perseverence is necessary to take you to a place where your problem-solving intuition allows you to exercise sound judgment not only in the most suitable approach to a solution, but also the likelihood of that approach being successful over an alternative.

The first 3 years of my PhD I spent reading around the topic and developing baseline approaches, most of which would eventually prove unfruitful. The path to completing it did no become fully clear until the last 6 months. Perseverence slowly unlocked a plausible approach. Coding problems match this also on a micro-scale, needing hours or sometimes days rather than months and years to solve.

#### Tenacity..

..as a way to solve not just one problem, but a constant flow of them, each perhaps needing a differnt approach. Natural language study throws out these problems at every turn. Likewise, coding as a means to an end result. Being able to break these problems down into smaller solvable ones is a skill acquired through tenacity and crucial for software development.

#### Cogency..

..as a route to clear conveyance of work and reasoning. Writing a PhD demands coherent, logical and convincing communication. It is no doubt useful to understand what you yourself mean to transmit when discussing or showing your work, but with built in cogency, others will also understand, and from that point, a truly collaboative environment can function well. With this in mind, I endeavor always to use best coding practices.
